Image Restorer, Department of Computer Science, LSU

- Working with LSUâ€™s Department of Computer Science to design a robust neural network model capable of removing distortion effects from images.

- Training the GAN model on different distortion effects such as motion blur, random occluding boxes, gaussian noise, color jitter, and various additional effects.

- Testing the model on real-life images CCTV footage and degraded images to evaluate its accuracy and applicability in criminal investigations.
